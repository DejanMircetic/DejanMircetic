  Hi there! Welcome.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a former Associate Professor and National Institutes of Health-funded Principal Investigator, who transitioned from academic research into data science and now product management. 

I love teaching, and I've led advanced workshops on literate programming and machine learning at conferences like `rstudio::conf`, R / Medicine, and R in Pharma.
